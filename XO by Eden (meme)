Am        Em                      G
    Yeah, she's in love with the concept
D
As if we're all just how she imagined
Am              Em                   G
Cause we're in love but just don't know it yet
D                                 C
Well, tell me how I'm supposed to see the magic
      
Pre-Chorus:
      Em                 D     C
Cause I don't believe in it no more
           Em        D
But I won't tell her, 
               C
Cause I always imagined
            Em      D         C
It's easier if she thinks she won
        Em      D
So Imma let her

Chorus:
                    Am
And she said I don't think
           Em 
I love you no more
D                          C 
You never seem to call me lately
     Am                        Em  
Girl I don't think you know me at all
D                     C
Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
            Am              Em
No, I don't love you, and I never did
           D                          C
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
            Am                            C
But just know, I'm not singing for your XO
         D                      
I'm just singing cause it's over

Am Em G D
-Uh, Yeah-

Verse:
Am        Em
Came and went like the summertime
G           D
Was that a sunset or sunrise
Am         Em                      G
Looking back like where'd the time go
    D                                  C 
So much for trying to keep this moving slow

Pre-Chorus:
                Em       D     C
Cause I don't believe in her no more
          Em            D 
But I remember,
Am                 Em                    D 
How we talked xxxx like we knew what we wanted
 C                      Em    D
And I still remember what she said

Chorus:
Am
I don't think
           Em 
I love you no more
D                          C 
You never seem to call me lately
     Am                        Em  
Girl I don't think you know me at all
D                     C
Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
            Am              Em
But I'm no liar, and I never hid
           D                          C
Anything, you should have seen it coming to this
            Am                            C
But just know, I'm not singing for an ex though
         D                      
I'm just singing cause it's over

Yeah, Yeah

Outro:
Am Em  G D
Yeah, Yeah
Am Em  G D
