Verse 1:
D                                  E7
My feathers seem to have taken the brunt of the storm
         G                  D
They are feeling pretty worn
D
We finally found shelter
       E7
Tucked away inside a wall
           G                   D
Though for now it's pretty small
 
Chorus:
G       D
You and me
       E7                 A
We can make this hole our home
       G               D                 A                   E7 G
We can fill it up with grass and all the things that make it warm
G        D
When you leave
       E7             A
To go fly across the sea
        G
I’ll be waiting here
     D              A                  E7
With Junior and the flowers that we’ve grown
 
Verse 2:
D
Collecting clumps of sticks and leaves
        E7
Has left me pretty tired
      G                      D
Can I rest with you a while?
D
We snuggle up between the stones
E7
Wind blows peacefully
           G                 D
There’s no place I’d rather be
 
Chorus:
G       D
You and me
       E7                 A
We can make this hole our home
       G               D                 A                   E7 G
We can fill it up with grass and all the things that make it warm
G        D
When you leave
       E7             A
To go fly across the sea
        G
I’ll be waiting here
     D              A                  E7         G
With Junior and the flowers that we’ve grown
