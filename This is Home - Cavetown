Intro: Cmaj7 Cm G

Verse:

Cmaj7    Cm       G                                   Cmaj7
 Often I am upset that I cannot fall in love but I guess 
                  Cm                       G
This avoids the stress of falling out of it 
Cmaj7        Cm         G                                      Cmaj7
 Are you tired of me yet? I'm a little sick right now but I swear 
               Cm                          G
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here 

Chorus:
 Em  C G
 Ooo oo oo, I'll cut my hair 
 Em  C  G
 Ooo oo oo, To make you stare 
 Em  C  G
 Ooo oo oo I'll hide my chest 
           Em                        Cm           G
 And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here 

 Em  C  G
 Ooo oo oo   x4

Verse:
Cmaj7              Cm        G                                           Cmaj7
 Turn off your porcelain face, I can't really think right now and this place 
               Cm                       G
 Has too many colours enough to drive all of us insane 
           Cmaj7      Cm                 G
 Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead 
                                                 Cmaj7
 Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head 
                   Cm                G
 But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet 

Chorus:
 Em  C  G
 Ooo oo oo My eyes went dark 
 Em  C  G
 Ooo oo oo I don't know where 
 Em  C  G
 Ooo oo oo, My pupils are 
            Em                      Cm           G
 But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here 

Bridge:
Em                       
 Get a load of this monster 
A
 He doesn't know how to communicate 
C                              
His mind is in a different place 
 G                                Bm7
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space
Em 
 Get a load of this train wreck                               
A                                              C          
 His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet 
                Cmaj7
 But little do we know, the stars 
                   G
 Welcome him with open arms 

Chorus:
 Em  C  G 
 Ooo oo oo, Time is 
 Em  C  G
 Ooo oo oo, Slowly 
 Em  C  G
 Ooo oo oo, Tracing his face 
       Em         Cm                      G
 But strangely he feels at home in this place
