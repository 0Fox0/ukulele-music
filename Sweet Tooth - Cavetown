Smoother on the edges, good as new

Gently into it, and every rendezvous

I know every line and curve of your tattoos

   Sweet tooth for you, my dreamin' space
           E7          Am      F        C
   It's filled with scribbles tore the page
      E7        Am    F       C
   Decipher them with colored paint
     E7         Am      F     C
   Repair the stitches in my veins

   I'll see you in my garden soon
      E7        Am       F    
   Beneath the skin it's cardiac

   a safety pin, I like you, say it  back
